# Problem 1:
# 1a:
# The output of this code will print
# 0
# 1
# 2

# 1b:
# The loop will execute 5 times.

# 1c:
# The output of this code will print
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5

# 1d:
# The output of this code will be
# 10
# 7
# 4
# 1

# 1e:
# In order for a while loop to stop, the loop condition must eventually evaluate to false.


# Problem 2:
# This for loop will print all even numbers between 1 and 50
# for i in range (1, 51):
#     if i % 2 == 0:
#         print(i)


# Problem 3:
# This while loop will calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100
# theSum = 0
# num = 1
# while num <= 100:
#     theSum += num
#     num += 1
# print(theSum)

# Problem 4:
